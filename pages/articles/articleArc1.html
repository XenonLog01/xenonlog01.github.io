    &emsp;Well after months of waiting, Intel's Arc GPUs have finally hit the market in China.
    At a planned MSRP of $130 to $140 USD in the US, the Arc A380 has been widely controversial, primarily
    due to news sites such as wccftech misreporting the price, confusing the price of the prebuilt computers
    the GPU comes in with the price of the GPU itself. Fortunately, most other sites caught this mistake,
    and sites such as PCGamer have properly reported the price of the Chinese cards at $150 USD.

  &emsp;Of course, these GPUs are young, and as a result, their drivers need a lot of work. As of now,
  games which use DirectX 11 suffer worse performance than the AMD RX6400.
